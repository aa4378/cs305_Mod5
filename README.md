## findSum Project
This project asks the user for two numbers in which they will be used for addition. After the two numbers are added, the project returns the sum of the two numbers 
back to the user.

# Dylan Franco contribution
## findDif Module
To this project I will be contributing a module that takes two numbers and finds the difference between them. I call it... Reverse addition.
